2. Color Palette:
	•	Primary Color:
	•	Blue (#0051ba): Represents trust, technology, and innovation.
	•	Secondary Color:
	•	White (#FFFFFF): For clean contrast and simplicity.
	•	Accent Color:
	•	Darker Blue (similar to #003f8c): Used in design variations for a subtle emphasis.
	•	Background:
	•	Either solid blue or black for digital contexts, with the logo in white for clarity.

3. Typography:
	•	Font Family: Sans-serif, modern fonts like Montserrat or Poppins to match the aesthetic of the logo.
	•	Font Weights: Use bold for headers (e.g., company name) and regular for subheadings or descriptions (e.g., “Technologies”).

4. Usage Guidelines:
	•	On Blue Background:
	•	Use the white version of the logo for optimal contrast.
	•	On White Background:
	•	Use the blue version of the logo for emphasis.
	•	On Black Background:
	•	Optionally use a monochrome white logo.

5. Spacing and Alignment:
	•	Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the “C” in “CHRISDEVCODE” to avoid crowding.
	•	Align the logo centrally in applications like banners, letterheads, or digital assets.

6. Applications:
	•	Website: Use the blue logo on light sections and white on dark sections.
	•	Business Cards: Opt for a white or black background with blue text for a professional appearance.
	•	Merchandise: Ensure contrast and clarity by adapting the logo to monochrome if needed.
